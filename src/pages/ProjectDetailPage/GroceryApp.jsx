        More than 3 billion people already benefit from AI-powered features in
        Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in Gmail or
        auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re excited to take the
        next step and bring a limited set of trusted testers a new set of
        features that makes the process of writing even easier. In Gmail and
        Google Docs, you can simply type in a topic you’d like to write about,
        and a draft will be instantly generated for you. So if you’re a manager
        onboarding a new employee, Workspace saves you the time and effort
        involved in writing that first welcome email. From there, you can
        elaborate upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be more
        playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be rolling out
        these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.
