          Google has been investing in AI for many years and bringing its

          publishing state-of-the-art research, building helpful products or
          developing tools and resources that enable others, we’re committed to
          making AI accessible to everyone. We’re now at a pivotal moment in our
          AI journey. Breakthroughs in generative AI are fundamentally changing
          how people interact with technology — and at Google, we’ve been
          responsibly developing large language models so we can safely bring
          them to our products. Today, we’re excited to share our early
          progress. Developers and businesses can now try new APIs and products
          that make it easy, safe and scalable to start building with Google’s
          best AI models through Google Cloud and a new prototyping environment
          called MakerSuite. And in Google Workspace, we’re introducing new
          features that help people harness the power of generative AI to
          create, connect and collaborate.

          More than 3 billion people already benefit from AI-powered features in
          Google Workspace, whether it’s using Smart Compose in Gmail or
          auto-generated summaries in Google Docs. Now, we’re excited to take
          the next step and bring a limited set of trusted testers a new set of
          features that makes the process of writing even easier. In Gmail and
          Google Docs, you can simply type in a topic you’d like to write about,
          and a draft will be instantly generated for you. So if you’re a
          manager onboarding a new employee, Workspace saves you the time and
          effort involved in writing that first welcome email. From there, you
          can elaborate upon or abbreviate the message or adjust the tone to be
          more playful or professional — all in just a few clicks. We’ll be
          rolling out these new experiences to testers in the coming weeks.

          We’re so excited by the potential of generative AI, and the
          opportunities it will unlock — from helping people express themselves
          creatively, to helping developers build brand new types of
          applications, to transforming how businesses and governments engage
          their customers and constituents. Stay tuned for more to come in the
          weeks and months ahead.
